# Choose-Work-Randomly

Choose-Work-Randomly is a script to choose random Work from my stack of todos written in Powershell Core.


## How it works

At the moment it only works for my xubuntu virtual machine. It steps 1 directory up and from there
thinks that the directories are the repositories I currently work on.
It will choose a random file and prompt me to work on it or
to add new todo items.
