# Script To Choose Random Work from my stack of todos

The script is written in Powershell Core and at the moment only for 
my xubuntu virtual machine. It steps 1 directory up and from there
thinks that the directories are the repositories I currently work on.
It will choose a random file and prompt me to work on it or
to add new todo items.
